# Files description

* `dodge.py` -- DODGE implementation
* `ghost.py` -- GHOST implementation
* `ghost-nondl.py` -- GHOST on non-DL (i.e., weighted losses + WFO on non-DL learners)
* `interp.py` -- Interpreting results
* `Pie charts of results...ipynb` -- The older (and wrong) method of generating pie charts and LaTeX table, but has code that is useful.
* `Get correct table...ipynb` -- The correct analysis; but does not generate a table or charts.
* `roundrobin.py` -- Code to run GHOST in a round robin way instead of train-test split locally
* `dodge-log/` -- DODGE results
* `ghost-nondl/` -- GHOST on non-DL results
* `orig-ghost-log/` -- GHOST results
